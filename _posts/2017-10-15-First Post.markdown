summary: First blog post ever, just the ramblings of a then-19 year old. Thinking about the past and the expectations we set before and how (kinda) disenchanted we are with how it is right now, but with hope for the future.

(Written August 7th)

As I sat in the quiet train car of an NJ transit and looked at the rain-drenched towns, houses, and people through the window, I thought it would be a good time to make this first blog post.

(To all of you that had a second to spare to come to my website and decided to read what I wrote today, thank you. For years, even maybe until last week, I thought that my words and ideas may not be worth posting on a website that maybe 10 people would go to and that would have no impact on them or on really anyone in the long run. Ehhh but what the heck, I'll do it anyway.)

I had a conversation with a friend one day in the middle of Washington Square Park in NYC, and does anyone want to take a guess what it might be about? Imagine, in the middle of one of the greatest cities in the world, full of vices and temptations and so many attractions, what could two 19-year-old Indian teenage boys be sitting and talking about that would warrant this post? I'll give you a second to guess.

(Before I continue, I want to assure you that this will not be some philosophical essay that will make you rethink your life and try to help you change your life for the better. I have no idea if what I’m doing is right or wrong, but for fun I thought I’ll write something out and just see what happens.)

SO back to the story.
We were talking about how we’ve been lied to all our lives. As children, we all saw our parents act with purpose, make incredibly important life decisions, take care of us, and enjoy life all at the same time. We wanted to grow up to be like them, to know all the answers, to have the magic sauce, to live every day with purpose and intent and make the right decisions. And because of this, as humans always do, we focused not on what we have, but on what we thought would come and wished for it to come even faster. Rather than enjoying our childhood, we pleaded with the gods or whatever we believed in to make time go faster like in sitcoms and just throw us to the time where we didn’t have to deal with school, homework, studying, or our parents.

Funny story about that one though. NONE OF IT IS TRUE.
The magical power we all thought would come to us once we hit the age of 18 or 19 or 20 or every next number…it doesn’t exist.
We wasted our time as kids hoping to be older and “settled”, but now we’re stuck, flopping around like fish, trying to breathe in the air and adapt to the newfound power and responsibilities we have.

Eventually we’ll flop back into the water and start swimming like our parents did, making every right movement, succeeding in life. Eventually we’ll forget all about the time where we didn’t know what the hell we were doing and maybe that there was ever a time that we were above the water. (If you want a better thing to read than this blathering post, read “This is Water” by David Foster Wallace.) But while we’re here, we should take advantage of it. Revel in the ignorance and not knowing what the right decision is, how it might affect us in the future, how it could fix everything or ruin it all.
Obsessing about the future ruins things in the present. Looking to the future, not enjoying where you are, fearing of missing out on something else but not taking every potential opportunity and living life to the fullest, that’s where everyone loses. Now or later, it’ll happen.
