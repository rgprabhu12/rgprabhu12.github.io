        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>A few weeks ago, I was volunteering through the International Society for a program called RocketWorld. A group of people, each from a different country, goes to an elementary school here in the suburbs of Manchester and just introduces the students to their country - the landmarks, culture, food, etc. Of course, my country to show off was the US, so I had photos of the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, the Hollywood Sign, the White House, among other different memorials and sights. I was showing off “southern/NC things”, like BBQ and hushpuppies, showing them a map of North Carolina and photos of the Raleigh skyline and my parents’ house in Cary, in an attempt to try and share some of America that might not be as mainstream across the pond as New York City or Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I got some general questions, like “Where’s New York?” or “Where does Lebron play?” or “Do you see YouTubers around a lot?” (this last one was lost on me - I was never much of a YouTube vlog watcher). But then… it began. I showed a picture of the US Capital, which a lot of kids thought was the White House at first, and then I followed that up with a picture of the White House, and a kid at the back said “OH That’s where TRUMP lives”.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Manchester is a very diverse city, with tons of international students and then just people from everywhere in Europe and from around the world. Near to my dorm, there is an area called Curry Mile, which has at least 60-70 Indian/Afghani/Syrian/Pakistani restaurants, so there is a large amount of Hindus and Muslims in Manchester and in the surrounding suburbs. This school is representative of the population, where there are tons of brown kids and even some little girls wearing hijabs.</p>

<p>As the groups shuffled through, people kept mentioning the “orange” man and even some of the teachers asked me about his policies and how he has changed the reputation of the country and all I could really do was smile and nod. One little girl, wearing a hijab, came up to me and asked, “Does Donald Trump hate Muslims?” — In that moment, I froze. The teacher of the group turned to look at me and waited for my response.  In my mind, I was conflicted. Do I tell this girl the truth that, yes, our elected leader has attacked Muslims in the media, implemented a Muslim ban (which another student asked about later), and has insulted refugees and immigrants from any and every country (except Scandinavia, apparently), regardless of religion or race? Is it my place to tell her this, as opposed to her parents or the teacher that is currently watching me?</p>

<p>What I ended up doing was tell her that “Umm no, there has just been some people that have attacked America in the past, and he’s just very cautious about that and immigrants in general, even though that isn’t really a problem anymore.”</p>

<p>What I should have said instead and what I regret not saying, is that, “Yes, he might, but him alone. He doesn’t represent all of America. Regardless of what you hear in the news and from him, the people of America are the most welcoming and if you ever come, they’re some of the nicest people in the world and would love to have you over.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Whenever someone asks me what race or ethnicity I am, I say Indian. I’m from North Carolina, born and raised, but I’m an Indian.
Through conversations with other first-generation immigrants (either born in US or immigrated at a very young age), I see that more and more, it’s the case that people identify as American or (insert race here)-American. Through my experiences, especially recently with the above-mentioned RocketWorld event, more and more, I’m increasingly less and less proud to be an American.</p>

<p>And before anyone reads into this too much - I know that I’m blessed to be from a country like America where I’ve been given so many different benefits (free K-12 education, stable government, the ability to practice my religion, etc.) over my 21 years. I’m thankful for what I’ve been given.
But in criticizing my government and asking for more, I’m utilizing one of those rights and benefits I’ve been given - to vocalize my concerns and complaints and work for our country to be better than it has been in the past few years (or increasingly we’ve seen, decades).</p>

<p>In America, we hear about what our government does and in a sense, we turn a blind eye / the news cycle moves too fast to have any sort of sensible reaction or action about it from the people.</p>

<p>Abroad, this isn’t the case. What small amounts of news they hear about the US is the big and the bad stuff. From the little girl above, to the other elementary school students and teachers talking about our president, to an Iranian man I met a few weeks ago saying that he hates our government but not American citizens — it really shows how much our reputation and standing in the world has taken a hit in the last few years.</p>
